2.  Look at the VCFs; one of these samples looks different. Can you identify which one, and explain why you think it is different?

Sample A is different to the rest. In sample a there is a region that is littered with indels (from 1,245,282 to 1,255,000). 
The average read depth for sample A as a whole is 58.0, compared to 49.8 and 49.9 for samples B & C. 
Furthermore, between bases, 1,245,282 and 1,255,000, the average read depth for the indel mutations is 96.4.



3. What do you think could explain your observation?

When sequencing the ‘indel’ region in sequence A, the DNA sample was likely contaminated with other DNA. 
When viewing the BAM file, roughly half of the sequencing reads contain SNPs absent in the other reads.
