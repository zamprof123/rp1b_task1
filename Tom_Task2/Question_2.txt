2.  Look at the VCFs; one of these samples looks different. Can you identify which one, and explain why you think it is different?

Sample A is different to the rest. In sample a there is a region (from 1,245,282 to 1,255,000bp) with a significantly higher density of mutations than the anywhere else, including in the other 2 samples. 



3. What do you think could explain your observation?

The assembler misassembled reads containing repeat sections of DNA. The average read depth in this region in Sample A is 96.4, compared to 58.0 for the sample A as a whole (and 50.2 excluding the aforementioned region). Average read depths for B & C are 49.8 and 49.7 respectively. The repeat sections were piled up on top of each other by the assembler.
