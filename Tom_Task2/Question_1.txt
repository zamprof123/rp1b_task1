  Question 1.1
What is the genome of sample X?

AGTA


  Question 1.2
How many SNPs apart are samples 1 and 2?

0


  Question 1.3
Ref = AGTACTA

Sample 1: 	3	TACT	T
Sample 2: 	2	GTAC	G

a) 	Sample 1: AGTA
	Sample 2: AGTA
b)	There are no differences between the 2 genomes
c)	Deletion of a series of nucleotides can be represented by multiple VCFs. Deletion of TAC from the above reference could be represented by both the VCFs written above.


  Question 1.4
Ref =		 AGACTACTG
Sample Y =	 AG- - -ACTG

Which of these correctly represents sample Y with respect to the reference?

2	GACT	G


  Question 1.5
Ref = AGTACTGT

VCF1: 3	TACTG	TC

VCF2: 3	TACT	T
   	   7	G		C

VCF3: 2	GTAC	G
	   7	G		C

Look at the 3 VCFs - can you compare their genomes?

VCF1 genome = AGTCT
VCF2 genome = AGTCT
VCF3 genome = AGTCT

All 3 VCFs share the same genome, however, the same genome results from 3 different routes.


  Question 1.6
Reference:	AGTCTTGACTACTACTACTGGG 
Sample:		AGTCTTGACTACTACTGGG

How many different VCF representations of the sample can you give?

16	TACT	T
16	TAC		T	+	19	TG     	G
16	TA		T	+	18	CTG  	G
16	T		G	+	17	ACTGG   G
17	ACTG	G
17	ACT		G	+	20	GG		G
17	AC		G	+	19	TG	  	G
17	A		G	+	18	CTGG	G
