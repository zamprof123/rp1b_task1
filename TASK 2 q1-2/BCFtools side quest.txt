bcftools complains about stuff when you don't have them in the specific format it wants.

yes you also have to index them

bcftools index BGvariants1.vcf.gz
bcftools index BGvariants2.vcf.gz
bcftools index BGvariants3.vcf.gz 
i'd try doing alot of this stuff in one line but i dont feel like breaking stuff.


the INDELS seem to be high quality, i think its using the phred scale, all above 200 >> really REALLY high quality.
i mean the question now is why they've occured.

save to files for cross-examination
bcftools stats BGvariants1.vcf.gz > VAR1STATS.txt
bcftools stats BGvariants2.vcf.gz > VAR2STATS.txt
bcftools stats BGvariants3.vcf.gz > VAR3STATS.txt
