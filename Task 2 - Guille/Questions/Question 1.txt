TASK 2 (Research Project 1B)

Question 1

Q.1.1
Ref = AGTGA
Here is the VCF of sample X
3 TG T
What is the genome of sample X?

Answer:
-> Sequence / Genome (sample X) = AGTA
A G T G A
A G - - A
A G T – A (Guanine deletion)

# ===================== #

Q.1.2
Ref = AGTTGA
VCF of sample 1
2 GT G
VCF of sample 2
3 TT T
How many SNPs apart are samples 1 and 2?

Answer:
Sequence (Sample 1) -> AGTGA
A G T T G A
A - - T G A
A G – T G A
Sequence (Sample 2) -> AGTGA
A G T T G A
A G - - G A
A G T – G A

•A single nucleotide is deleted across both samples one (Thymine) and two (Cytosine) were identified. However, based on these findings, samples 1 and 2 are 0 SNPs apart, given that both sequences are 
identical.

# ===================== #

Q.1.3
Ref = AGTACTA
VCF of sample 1
3 TACT T
VCF of sample 2
2 GTAC G
a) Obtain the genomes of samples 1 and 2 (and tell me what they are)
b) Identify the differences between those two genomes
c) Compare what you learn from b) with what you get from comparing VCFs above

Answer:
a)Sequences (Sample 1) -> AGTA, (Sample 2) -> AGTA. Sample 1 is a deletion of 3 nucleotides (ACT) from the reference genome, starting at position 3. Sample 2 refers to a parallel deletion of 3 
nucleotides (TAC) respective to the reference genome, starting at position 2.

Sample 1:
A G T A C T A
A G - - - - A
A G T - - - A
Sample 2:
A G T A C T A
A - - - - T A
A G - - - T A

b)There are no positional nucleotide differences between both genomes (0 SNPs apart).
c)Despite null differences in overall nucleotide composition across both genomes (AGTA), they differ in how the reference genome was altered. This is due to sample 1-specific VCF deleting ATGA at 
position 3, while the VCF concerning sample 2 suggests a deletion starting from position 3; however, both VCFs result in a 3-nucleotide-wide deletion.

Q.1.4 
Ref = AGACTACTG
Sample Y = AG---ACTG
Which of these correctly represents sample Y with respect to the reference?
-> 2 GACT G
3 ACTA A
4 CTAC C
5 TACT T

Answer:
Sample Y = A G - - - A C T G
Correct VCF -> 2 GACT G

# ===================== #

Q.1.5 
Most of the time, you need multiple records to describe a sample. Let’s look at 3 VCFs (with respect
to this reference: AGTACTGT). Can you compare their genomes?
VCF1
3 TACTG TC
VCF2
3 TACT T
7 G C
VCF3
2 GTAC G
7 G C

Answer:
VCF 1 (3 TACTG TC)
Sequence -> AGTCT
A G T A C T G T
A G - - - - - T
A G T C - - - T 

VCF 2 (3 TACT T) & (7 G C)
Sequence -> AGTCT
A G T A C T G T
A G - - - - - T
A G T - - - C T

VCF 3 (2 GTAC G) &  (7 G C)
Sequence -> AGTCT
A G T A C T G T
A - - - - T – T
A G - - - T C T

The genomes corresponding to all 3 samples are identical (0 SNPs apart).
