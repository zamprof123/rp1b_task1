Q1. AGTA
 
Q2. Sample 1 and 2 are zero SNPs apart.
 
Q3a.AGTA
Sample 1: AGT - - - A
Sample 2: AG - - - TA
Q3b.
They produce the same sequence but have SNP mutations at different locations. So they are zero SNPs apart.
Q3c. Although the VCFs of samples 1 and 2 indicate deletions occurring at different positions relative to the reference genome, they produce the same sequence of AGTA. Therefore, they are zero SNP mutations apart. The differences occur specifically at position 3, where Sample 1 has T and Sample 2 has a deletion, and position 6, where Sample 2 has T and Sample 1 has a deletion.

Q4 . 2 GACT G correctly represents sample Y
 
 Q5. The genomes from VCF 1, 2 and 3 are the same but VCF 1 occurs due to SNP mutation whereas VCF 2 and 3 have both SNP and Indel mutations occurring.

Q6.
 VCFâ€™s possible:

(Four ACT deletion)
 7 GACT to  G
10 TACT to T
13 TACT to T
16 TACT to T

(Three CTA deletion)
8 ACTA to A
11 ACTA to A
14 ACTA to A

(Three TAC deletion)
9 CTAC to C
12 CTAC to C
15 CTAC to C
