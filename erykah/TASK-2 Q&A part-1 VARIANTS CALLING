TASK-2 part 1 Q&A

ANSWER 1.1
Sample X = AGTA

ANSWER 1.2
Samples 1 and 2 are zero SNPs apart. Since, after the alteration in the sequence, both samples 1 and 2 have the same genome sequence after the deletion in different positions.

ANSWER 1.3
a. Both samples 1 & 2 obtain the same 'AGTA'  new genome sequence. They are zero SNPs apart.

b. There are zero genomic differences between sample 1 & 2. Although, both the genomes had specific indels/deletions occurring at different positions, irrespective to their reference genome.

c. Comparing the samples 1 & 2 with respect to their reference genome, sample 1 has a deletion at position 3 from 'T', whereas, sample 2 had a deletion at position 2 from 'G'. Regardless of their indels, both the samples come out with the same new sequence.

ANSWER 1.4
Sample Y = 2 GACT G

ANSWER 1.5
All the genomes from the VCFs 1,2 and 3 are the same after mutation. Except for their outcomes. VCF 1 genome occurs due to SNP mutation and VCFs 2 and 3 have both, SNPs and indel deletions/mutations.

ANSWER 1.6
4 ACT deletions:
Pos  Ref  Alt 
7    GACT  G
10   TACT  T
12   TACT  T
16   TACT  T

3 CTA deletions:
Pos  Ref   Alt
8    ACTA   A
11   ACTA   A
14   ACTA   A

3 TCA deletions:
Pos  Ref   Alt
9    CTAC   C
12   CTAC   C
15   CTAC   C
