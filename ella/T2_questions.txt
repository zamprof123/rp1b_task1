Q1.1 
Ref   = AGTGA
Here is the VCF of sample X
3  TG  T

What is the genome sample of X?
AGTA

Q1.2
Ref   = AGTTGA
VCF of sample 1
2  GT  G
VCF of sample 2
3  TT  T

How many SNPs apart are samples 1 & 2?

Sample 1: AGTGA
Sample 2: AGTGA
They are zero SNPs apart. They have the same sequence.

Q1.3
 Ref   = AGTACTA
 VCF of sample 1
 3  TACT  T          		AGT---A
 VCF of sample 2
 2  GTAC  G			AG---TA

a) Obtain the genome samples of samples 1 & 2. Tell me what they are.
sample 1: AGTA
sample 2: AGTA
Both of the mutations are deletions

b) Identify the differences between those two genomes
There are no differences in the genomes. The alignment with the reference genome will be different
VCF1: AGT---A
VCF2: AG---TA

c) Compare what you learn from b) with what you get from comparing VCFs above
Different mutations can lead to the same sequence forming


Q1.4
Ref      = AGACTACTG
Sample Y = AG---ACTG
Which of these correctly represents sample Y with respect to the reference?

2  GACT   G

Q1.5
Most of the time, you need multiple records to describe a sample.
Letâ€™s look at 3 VCFs (with respect to this reference: AGTACTGT). Can you compare their genomes?

 VCF1
 3  TACTG   TC

 VCF2
 3  TACT    T
 7  G       C

 VCF3
 2  GTAC    G
 7  G       C

VCF1: AGTCT
VCF2: AGTCT
VCF3: AGTCT

Their genomes are the exact same

Q1.6
Reference AGTCTTGACTACTACTACTGGG
Sample      AGTCTTGACTACTACTGGG
How many different VCF representations of the sample can you give?

VCF1: 7   GACT   G 			
VCF2: 8   ACTA    A
VCF3: 10  TACT   T
VCF4: 11  ACTA  A
VCF5: 13  TACT   T
VCF6: 14 ACTA   A
VCF7: 16  TACT   T

VCF8:
6   TGAC      T
10   T             G

VCF9:  
9    CTAC    C

VCF10:
12  CTAC     C
