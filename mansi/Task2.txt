Task 2 Question 1.1
Answer AGTA

Question 1.2
Answer samples 1 and 2 are 2 SNPs apart

Question 1.3
a) AGTA, AGTA
b) There are no differences in their final sequences. Sample 1 modifies Position 3 by removing ACT and sample 2 modifies Position 2 by removing TAC.
c)Both Sample 1 and Sample 2 resolve to the same final genome: AGTA. The two samples are 2 SNPs apart, corresponding to the unique changes at position 2 (Sample 2) and position 5 (Sample 1).

Question 1.4
Answer   3  ACTA  A

Question 1.5
VCF1 genome =  AGTCT

VCF2 genome =  AGTCT

VCF3 genome =  AGTCT

VCF1: Uses a single change at position 3, replacing TACTG with with TC

VCF2: Uses two changes - at position 3 replacing TACT with T, and at position 7 replacing G with C

VCF3: Uses two changes - at position 2 replacing GTAC with G, and at position 7 replacing G with C


Question 1.6
Answer 
13 TACTACT TACT
14 ACTACT ACT
15 CTACT CT
16 TACT T
17 ACTG G

b) Sample 1 appears different from Samples 2 and 3 because of different VCF representations and sequencing coverage variations.
c)The lack of immediate space/depth after the first SNP in Sample 1's TV view versus Samples 2 and 3 is because different VCF representations can achieve the same final sequence in different ways.
  The difference in depth numbers (70 in Sample 1 vs 40 in Samples 2 and 3) around their respective SNPs (3406, 775, and 4555) is likely due to variations in sequencing coverage at those specific positions.
