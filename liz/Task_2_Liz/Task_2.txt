Q1.1 : AGTA

Q1.2 : 0 SNPs part since they have the same genome AGTGA

Q1.3 :

a)
   Sample_1: AGTA 
   Sample_2: AGTA

b) 
   Sample_1: AGT---A  following the T base is an deletion of 3 bases (ACT)
   Sample_2: AG---TA  following the G base is an deletion of 3 bases (TAC)

c)      Ref: AGTACTA
   Sample_1: AGT---A
   Sample_2: AG---TA
   
   Both sample 1 and 2 's genomes have 3 bases of deletion but they are in different positions and in the end have the same genomes meaning different base mutations in separate samples could give the same sequence.

Q1.4 : 2 GACT G

Q1.5 :
        Ref: AGTACTGT
   Sample_1: AGT-C--T 
   Sample_2: AGT---CT
   Sample_3: AG---TCT

They all have the same genome.

Q1.6 : 

There could be 10 variant representations of this sample genome.

POS REF        ALT
7   GACT	G
8   ACTA	A 	
9   CTAC        C
10  TACT	T
11  ACTA	A
12  CTAC	C
13  TACT	T
14  ACTA	A
15  CTAC  	C
16  TACT	T	

Q2 : 

2.2 Sample 1 is different from the Reference genome since from the VCF file, there are some INDELs in sample 1 starting from position 1245282 with deletion of tg and other positions eg. pos1255000 insertion of an G etc. But INDEL is not happening in the other two samples' genomes(only SNPs).
Besides, from the 1kb mean coverage outputs, the depth in this section is 2x higher in sample 1(90% - 107%) than the depth in the other two sample genomes(43% -58%).


2.3

Given that the reference genome is from M.tuberculosis which is a haploid, INDELs directly reflect difference from the reference genome, the INDELs and 2x coverage could suggest gene duplication or repetitive sequences.
