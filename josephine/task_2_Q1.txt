#~~~~~~~~ Task 2 ~~~~~~~~~~#
#~ Question 1.1 ~#

The genome of sample X is AGTA (AGT-A)


#~ Question 1.2 ~#

Sample 1 has a sequence variant at position 2, replacing "GT" in the reference with "G" in the alternative genome.
The resulting sequence is AGTGA (AG-TGA).

Sample 2 has sequence variants at position 3, replacing "TT" in the reference with "T" in the alternative genome. 
The resulting sequence is AGTGA (AGT-GA).

Hence, they are identical alternative genomes and are zero SNPs apart. 

#~ Question 1.3 ~#

a) 
Sample 1 has a sequence variant at position 3, replacing "TACT" in the reference with "T" in the alternative genome.
The resulting sequence is AGTA (AGT---A)

Sample 2 has a sequence variant at position 2, replacing "GTAC" in the reference with "G" in the alternative genome.
The resulting sequence is AGTA (AG---TA)

Both are deletions.

b) Samples 1 and 2 have identical genomes. 

c) Importantly, although there are multiple VCFs that represent differences between the sample variants, inherently the sequences in sample 1 and 2 are the same. Different variant callers will result in record-specific variant calls but are not indicative of the final alternative genome sequence.

#~ Question 1.4 ~#

2 GACT G ==> Sequence variant at position 2, replacing "GACT" in the reference with "G" in the alternative ==> AGACTG 
3 ACTA A ==> Sequence variant at position 3, replacing "ACTA" in the reference with "A" in the alternative ==> AGACTG
4 CTAC C ==> Sequence variant at position 4, replacing "CTAC" in the reference with "C" in the alternative ==> AGACTG
5 TACT T ==> Sequence variant at position 2, replacing "GACT" in the reference with "G" in the alternative ==> AGACTG

Answer: All of the variants represent the same Sample Y genome with respect to the reference. 

#~ Question 1.5 ~#

VCF 1: 3 TACTG TC ==> Sequence variant at position 3, replacing "TACTG" in the reference with "TC" in the alternative ==> Alt: AGTCT

VCF 2: 
3 TACT T ==> Sequence variant at position 3, replacing "TACT" in the reference with "T" in the alternative ==> Alt: AGTCT
7 G C ==> Sequence variant at position 7, replacing "G" in the reference with "C" in the alternative 
==> Alt: AGTACTCT

VCF3:
2 GTAC G ==> Sequence variant at position 2, replacing "GTAC" in the reference with "G" in the alternative ==> Alt: AGTCT
7 GC G ==> Sequence variant at position 2, replacing "GTAC" in the reference with "G" in the alternative ==> Alt: AGTCT

Answer: All VCFs, except possibly VCF1 (which may be a typo), represent the same variant calls relative to the reference genome for the given sample
