#~~~~~~~~ Task 2 ~~~~~~~~~~#
#~ Question 1.1 ~#

The genome of sample X is AGTA


#~ Question 1.2 ~#

Sample 1 has sequence variant at position 2, replacing "GT" in the reference with "G" in the alternative genome.
The resulting sequence is AGTGA

Sample 2 has sequence variants at position 3, replacing "TT" in the reference with "T" in the alternative genome. 
The resulting sequence is AGTGA. 

Hence, they are identical alternative genomes and are zero SNPs apart. 

#~ Question 1.3 ~#

a) 
Sample 1 has sequence variant at position 3, replacing "TACT" in the reference with "T" in the alternative genome.
The resulting sequence is AGTA

Sample 2 has sequence variant at position 2, replacing "GTAC" in the reference with "G" in the alternative genome.
The resulting sequence is AGTA

Both are deletions.

b) Sample 1 and 2 have identical genomes. 

c) Importantly, although there are multiple VCFs that represent differences between the sample variants, inherently the sequences in sample 1 and 2 are the same. Different variant callers will result in record specific variant calls but not indicative of the final alternative genome sequence.

#~ Question 1.4 ~#

2 GACT G ==> Sequence variant at position 2, replacing "GACT" in the reference with "G" in the alternative ==> AGACTG
3 ACTA A ==> Sequence variant at position 3, replacing "ACTA" in the reference with "A" in the alternative ==> AGACTG
4 CTAC C ==> Sequence variant at position 4, replacing "CTAC" in the reference with "C" in the alternative ==> AGACTG
5 TACT T ==> Sequence variant at position 2, replacing "GACT" in the reference with "G" in the alternative ==> AGACTG

Answer: All of the variants represent the same Sample Y genome in respect to the reference. 

#~ Question 1.5 ~#

VCF 1: 3 TACTG TC ==> Sequence variant at position 3, replacing "TACTG" in the reference with "TC" in the alternative ==> Alt: AGTCT

VCF 2: 
3 TACT T ==> Sequence variant at position 3, replacing "TACT" in the reference with "T" in the alternative ==> Alt: AGTCT
7 G C ==> Sequence variant at position 7, replacing "G" in the reference with "C" in the alternative 
==> Alt: AGTACTCT

VCF3:
2 GTAC G ==> Sequence variant at position 2, replacing "GTAC" in the reference with "G" in the alternative ==> Alt: AGTCT
7 GC G ==> Sequence variant at position 2, replacing "GTAC" in the reference with "G" in the alternative ==> Alt: AGTCT

Answer: All VCFs, except possibly VCF1 (which may be a typo), represent the same variant calls relative to the reference genome for the given sample
