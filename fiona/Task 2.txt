Q1(1.1) Ref = AGTGA
                       
 Position  Ref  Alt  
   3       TG    T

Here, G is deleted in position 3 giving the genome AGTA. 

Q1(1.2) Ref = AGTTGA

VCF of sample 1 
Position  Ref  Alt 
  2       GT    G

VCF of sample 2 
Position  Ref  Alt 
  3       TT    T

The genome is AGTGA for both the samples. Therefore, they are 0 SNPs apart because, the sequences of both the genomes are same even after deletion in sample 1 and 2. 

Q1(1.3) Ref = AGTACTA

VCF of sample 1 
Position  Ref   Alt  
  3       TACT   T

The genome after deletion of ACT is AGTA.

VCF of sample 2 
Position  Ref   Alt 
  2       GTAC   G

The genome after the deletion of TAC is AGTA. 

a) The genomes obtained in sample 1 and 2 are AGTA, because of deletion.  
b) There is no difference in the genome we get even though ACT at position 3 and TAC at position 2 gets deleted in both the samples. No other difference other than the change of positions in each of the samples.
c) From b, it is understood that, the reference genome given is AGTACTA, and the deletion of ACT from the position of 3 in sample 1, and the deletion of TAC from the position of 2 in sample 2 resulted in giving the same genome (AGTA) for both the samples. 

Q1(1.4) The correct answer is,
        
        Position  Ref   Alt

Q1(1.5) VCF1
        Position  Ref     Alt  
          3       TACTG   TC
 
VCF1 genome is AGTCT. Insertion and deletion at the same time- INDEL MUTATION.

Q2(2.2) The difference noticed is that sample 1 exhibits INDEL mutations with SNPs at the regions(1245282~1255000). While sample 2 and sample 3 shows only SNP mutations in majority of the regions.
