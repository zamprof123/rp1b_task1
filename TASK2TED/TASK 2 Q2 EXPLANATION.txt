Task 2 Q2.2
sample 1 appears to be the odd-one-out here as it is the only one that contains INDELs, curiously this region also has approximately double the read depth of other areas (mean read depth for the rest of the sample is about ~50, while here it spikes to around ~100)
All of the indels in sample 1 occur between positions 1245282 and 1255000, they have high phred scores and likely arent the result of low quality data.

Q2.3
Possible duplication of the gene within the sample, this would explain why the depth doubles and approximately half of the reads possess the mutation, while the other half do not. It is unlikely to be contamination on account of it being limited to such a small region (10k), and its similarity to the reference sequence.


genome assembly imperfect

sample 1 has a bunch of indels, lower case letters in the new entry show original characters/deleted characters capital letters are NEW characters
samples 2 and 3 do not have any indels present
INDELS present between 1245282 and 1255000
