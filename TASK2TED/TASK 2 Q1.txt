1.1
Ref = AGTGA
Here is the VCF of sample X
3 TG T
What is the genome of sample X ?
AGTA

1.2
Ref = AGTTGA
VCF of sample 1
2 GT G >> (AG*TGA)
VCF of sample 2
3 TT T >> (AGT*GA)
How many SNPs apart are samples 1 and 2?
0 SNPs apart, same sequence (AGTGA)

1.3
Ref = AGTACTA
VCF of sample 1
3 TACT T >> AGT***A
VCF of sample 2
2 GTAC G >> AG***TA

a) Obtain the genomes of samples 1 and 2 (and tell me what they are)

Shown next to the VCF entries. Sample 1 results in AGTA, sample 2 results in AGTA (specific deletions shown above)
b) Identify the differences between those two genomes
Within the genomes alone, there appears to be no discernable differences.

c) Compare what you learn from b) with what you get from comparing VCFs above
The VCF's allow you to see the specifics of what's been deleted in each sample, in the first one we see a 3 nuc. deletion (ACT) starting at pos 4 and in sample 2 we see another 3 nucleotide deletion, this time of TAC, starting at pos 3. We see two different changes resulting in identical sequences, as opposed to just looking at the raw genomes here, that show nothing more than that the sample sequences are identical- Unfortunately we cannot infer anything more than that without some phylogenetic background as we do not know if this if this is a gain of function from the ref to the samples or a loss of function from the samples to the ref.

1.4
Ref = AGACTACTG
Sample Y = AG---ACTG
Which of these correctly represents sample Y with respect to
the reference?
2 GACT G << THIS IS CORRECT.
3 ACTA A
4 CTAC C
5 TACT T

1.5
Most of the time, you need multiple
records to describe a sample.
Letâ€™s look at 3 VCFs (with respect
to this reference: AGTACTGT). Can
you compare their genomes?

VCF1
3 TACTG TC
>> AGTC***T

VCF2
3 TACT T
7 G C
>> AGT***GT >> AGT***CT

VCF3
2 GTAC G
7 G C
>> AG***TGT >> AG***TCT

all resulting genomes are identical, despite the vcf entries having the deletions in different positions, the actual genomes end up both being AGTCT.
1.6

Reference AGTCTTGACTACTACTACTGGG
Sample AGTCTTGACTACTACTGGG
How many different VCF representations of the sample can you
give?

7 GACT G
8 ACTA A
9 CTAC C
10 TACT T
11 ACTA A
12 CTAC C
13 TACT T
14 ACTA A
15 CTAC C
16 TACT T
17 ACTA A

You could generate a number of other redundant VCF entries if you were to start replacing the sections with more than one character:
e.g 6 CGACT CG
This is perfectly valid and potentially something that would pop up in an actual vcf, but also paves the way for far too many varitants to mention, so these will be ommited for the sake of brevity.
